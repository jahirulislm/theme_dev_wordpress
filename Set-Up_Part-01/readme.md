##Files and folders
####WordPress themes are nothing more than a collection of various files that rely on different web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. Block themes also follow a standard structure in how many of those files are laid out.

####At its most basic, a themeâ€™s structure will look similar to the following. Take note of the files/folders marked required because they are necessary for a block theme to work:

*parts/
*footer.html
*header.html
*patterns/
*example.php
*styles/
*example.json
*templates/
*404.html
*archive.html
*index.html (required)
*singular.html
*README.txt
*functions.php
*screenshot.png
*style.css (required)
\*theme.json
